Chilling Experiment 2015/2016

README started 14 December 2017

General: The bud chill experiment was done in winter 2015-2016 (meaning December 2015 to whatever month in 2016) and led by Dan Flynn with help from Tim Savas. 

Based on my best available knowledge:
- Field collection happened at Harvard Forest on 18 December 2015 (see Budchill experiment 2016 log.pdf)
- Forcing conditions were the same for everything coming out of chilling: So forcing day/night was 20/10 deg C, with 12 h photoperiod. 
- Chilling photoperiod: from Dan Flynn on 3 Nov 2017: I believe we kept them dark the whole time, as in a refrigerator study. The walk-cold room (in the E lab) just has fluorescent lights and no timer on the lights, so it would have not been possible to have the same light conditions across the chilling temperatures. Temps were the same day/night.
- We then had:
	- WLO (warm-long day-zero additional chilling)
	- chill 1 (1 degree day and night)
	- chill 2 (2 degrees day and night)
	- chill 4 (4 degrees day and night)
	- chill 8 (8 degrees day and night)	
	- We varied how long chilling lasted (3 different time points)… 
		- Based on Budchill prep.R and Budchill experiment 2016 log.pdf we think we had:
		- 1 January (no chill)
		- 16 January (16 days)
		- 2 February (32 days)
- Humidity was set at 85% and C02 is noted as 400 ppm, but I am not sure if we had it on.
- We worked on 6 species (I believe):
	(1) ACESAC
	(2) BETALL
	(3) HAMVIR
	(4) ILEMUC
	(5) QUERUB
	(6) VIBCAS
